##Instructions

- Download from the releases tab, extract to Fallout4\\Data\\
- Enable the plugin (ScrapGrinder.esp) in whatever mod manager you use.
- Build a scrapping bench in one of your settlements. It is found in the Crafting section of the Workshop menu.
- There should be a footlocker named "Scrap Container" on top of the workbench. Place any junk items you want to scrap in this container.
    Non-Junk items will be returned to you as you add them.
- Use the scrapping bench (Press E) and select where you want to send its output through the crafting menu.


##Installation

- Use NMM or extract ScrapGrinder.esp and the Scripts folder to your Data folder.
- Activate ScrapGrinder.esp using your preferred method.
- the docs folder includes the source files for the scripts used by this mod for anyone that's curious how it works.


##Updating

- Uninstall any previous version.
- A clean save is probably required to update to v0.9 without issues.
- It's probably best to scrap and rebuild any workbenches created with previous versions before uninstalling version prior to 0.9.


##Notes

- Only works for default components for now.
    - This only affects new components. Mods that change component amounts are fully compatible.
    - A compatibility script for other mods will be added in a future release.
